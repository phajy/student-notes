    "text": "Here are some notes and answers to student questions.\n\n\n\n\nPart (b) states that you have made some measurements of \\(H(z)\\) and want to determine the equation of state of the Universe, with the cosmological constant being regarded as a dark energy component of the material. The question is to find an expression for the density and pressure of the Universe in terms of \\(H(z)\\).\nThe FRW equations are on the formula sheet and if we take \\(\\Lambda\\) to be a matter field we can absorb it into the definitions of \\(\\rho\\) and \\(P\\) 1. So we get\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH^2 + \\frac{k}{a^2} &= \\frac{8\\pi}{3} \\rho \\\\\n-qH^2 &= -\\frac{4\\pi}{3}(\\rho + 3P) \\\\\n\\dot{\\left( \\rho a^3 \\right)} &= -P\\dot{\\left( a^3 \\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can rearrange the first of these to get the density \\[\n\\rho = \\frac{3}{8\\pi} H^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{k}{a^2H^2} \\right)\n\\]\nThe \\(k\\) term is expected to be small since the Universe is known to be quite flat, be we can show its dependence on \\(z\\) and \\(H(z)\\) by writing it as \\[\n\\frac{k}{a^2H^2} = \\frac{k}{a_0^2} \\frac{(1+z)^2}{H^2} .\n\\]\nNow for the pressure we can use either of the other two expressions, but since we have derived an expression for \\(q\\) earlier, it’s perhaps simplest to start from \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nqH^2 &= \\frac{4\\pi}{3}(\\rho + 3P) \\\\\nP &= \\frac{qH^2}{4\\pi} - \\frac{\\rho}{3} \\\\\n&= \\frac{qH^2}{4\\pi} - \\frac{1}{8\\pi} H^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{k}{a^2H^2} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{H^2}{4\\pi} \\left( q - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{k}{2a^2H^2} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{H^2}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{H^\\prime}{H} (1+z) - \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{k}{a_0^2} \\frac{(1+z)^2}{H^2} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] which gives \\(P\\) in therms of \\(H(z)\\) and \\(z\\).\n\n\n\nIf the universe is flat, \\(k = 0\\), so the expressions for \\(P\\) and \\(\\rho\\) simplify to \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho &= \\frac{3}{8\\pi} H^2 \\\\\nP &= \\frac{H^2}{4\\pi} \\left( \\frac{H^\\prime}{H} (1+z) - \\frac{3}{2} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor the power-law expression given in the question \\[\n\\frac{H^\\prime}{H} = \\frac{n}{1+z}\n\\]  so that \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho &= \\frac{3}{8\\pi} H^2 \\\\\nP &= \\frac{n-3/2}{4\\pi} H^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] and \\[\n\\frac{P}{\\rho} = \\frac{2n - 3}{3} .\n\\]\nThis means that if \\(n = 0\\) we get the usual cosmological constant dominated result for the equation of state. If \\(n = 3/2\\) we get the dust equation of state. If \\(n = 2\\) we get the radiation dominated equation of state. Extracting the correct information about the equation of state therefore means being able to measure \\(n\\) to better than about 0.1 accuracy (to distinguish dust from radiation) or 0.3 accuracy (to distinguish cosmological constant from dust). In fact at around \\(z = 1\\) we expect a value of \\(n\\) between 0 and 1.5 because the Universe is making the transition to its current cosmological-constant dominated expansion from the dust-dominated regime. A departure from this would be big news!\n\n\n\n\nI’ll expand on the solution a little bit. Also, a general note regarding scalars – they can be calculated in the most convenient frame because they are invariant and hence the same in any frame. The question doesn’t really explain where the expression comes from but you can take a look at, e.g., this paper by Crawford & Tereno (2002).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nv_\\text{rel}^2 &= \\frac{(g_{\\alpha\\beta} + u_\\alpha u_\\beta) v^\\alpha v^\\beta}{(u_\\alpha v^\\alpha)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{v_\\beta v^\\beta + (u_\\alpha v^\\alpha) (u_\\beta v^\\beta)}{(u_\\alpha v^\\alpha)^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{(-1) + (u_\\alpha v^\\alpha)^2}{(u_\\alpha v^\\alpha)^2} \\\\\n&= 1 - \\frac{1}{(u_\\alpha v^\\alpha)^2}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]"
